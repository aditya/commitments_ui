  You have new updates to look at with commitments, just click the link and go.

  Commitments uses email based login, we've figured out:

  * You already have too many usernames and passwords
  * You probably click 'forgot password a lot'

  So, we cut to the chase, and just send you an email to log in. If you
  lose this email, or othewise get logged out, you can always request a
  new link.

  The best part? We don't have your password, you didn't give it to us.
  So, it can never be stolen or hacked... just don't forward this email!

  And, we deeply reject the notion of **no-reply@**. Reply to this.
  Contact us any time.
